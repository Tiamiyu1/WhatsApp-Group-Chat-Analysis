Just as I left the hospital.

Before I got to the intersection.

They pulled before us in a black Toyota Sienna.

Blocking us from moving further.

These men.

In black and blue jeans.

And black tight t-shirts.

Heavily armed.

Sunglasses as usual.

Climbed out of the vehicle.

My driver exhaled heavily.

"These people again."

Eight men.

Two moved toward the Taxify.

Gun raised.

Cocking their rifles as though they had caught some criminals.

I sat calmly.

If you are a young man who frequents Taxify or Uber in Lagos, you'd probably get used to that embarrassment.

I had nothing with me just my phone.

And the medication I had gotten from the hospital.

I was so weak.

Massive headache.

While they approached I asked my driver.

"Who are those guys?"

"Haaa. Bros, na SARS o."

I said.

"I thought they have banned these guys?"

He looked at me.

"For wia. Na today?"

I sighed.

The two approached one on each side of the car. I kept my hands in plain sight and made no sudden moves.

One of the men shouted at my driver.

"You no go wind down? Abi you want us to beg you?"

The Taxify driver quickly hit the window button as he screamed forcing a smile.

"Aaah officer of the law no vex, sir! I throw way salute."

The one who had shouted approached my window.

I was looking away.

He shouted.

"Oga, you no dey greet person abi you no see us?"

I slowly turned my head and looked at him.

"Officer, good afternoon, sir."

"Afternoon. Who are you?"

I was about to answer.

He shouted.

"Oga, come down?!"

One of his folks standing a few steps away shouted.

"Who be dis person wey no dey hear us? Na one of those protesters? Devil go welcome am for hell now if he be one of those protesters."

He cocked his gun and approached my Taxify.

It was a lonely road.

No onlookers.

A few cars passed by the other side of the lane.

I gently got down from the car.

I greeted again.

Both of them.

"Officers, good afternoon, sir."

My driver came out and said.

"Na my passenger! I pick am from that hospital down the road."

The one who had asked me who I am shouted at him.

"Shut up! Did we ask you anything? You dey mad? Your moda!"

Then he turned to me.

"Oga, who are you?"

"My name is Kyrian Chiemelie, sir."

"What do you do? Wetin dey your pocket?"

"I am a writer, sir."

"Journalist?"

"No, sir. Author, scriptwriter, filmmaker, sir."

"Oga, wetin dey your pocket?"

"My phone, sir."

"Bring it out."

I dug out my phone.

"Unlock it."

"Why?"

The other one shouted attracting the rest, pointing his gun at him.

"You are asking us questions? Are you stupid?"

I said.

"No, sir. But none of you has the right to search my phone. I didn't do anything wrong."

One shouted, running toward us.

"Who dey yarn that rubbish? Na one of the protesters? Shoot the modafuvker!"

The other one said.

"We never know na when we search him phone we go know."

The Taxify driver said to me.

"Please, unlock your phone. You know what is going on already."

The one pointing rifle at me shouted.

Eyes widened.

Dark lips.

Unsmiling face.

"Oga, unlock your phone for the last time!"

As I used my fingerprint he snatched my phone from me immediately.

Handed it to the last folk who approached us.

He seemed to be the leader.

He started to go through my phone as he said.

"What did you say you do again?"

"I am a filmmaker, sir."

"Actor?"

I shook my head.

"Basically writing."

He looked at me.

"You look tired."

I said.

"I just dey come back from the hospital. The one down there."

"Wetin dey do you? COVID-19?"

"No, sir. Na stress and little sickness. My doctor has given me some tablets, I will be fine in a couple of days."

As he scrolled through my phone the others watched.

Gun pointed up, down. A few at me.

I remained chilled.

He asked.

"And you are not one of the end SARS protesters."

I remained silent.

One of them moved toward me as though he wanted to hit me his rifle.

I dodged.

"Oga, dey ask you, you dey ignore am."

The man said.

"Leave am. Make I see end SARS pictures on his phone first and he is gone with the gun."

I was still silent.

A few minutes later.

One said to the one with my phone.

"Oga, did you see any pictures of end SARS on his phone?"

"I never see one."

I said.

"Sir, can I go, please? There is nothing on my phone."

He looked at me.

"Are you teaching us our job?"

"Not at all, sir. But there is nothing on my phone. My doctor said I should not stand too long."

Two laughed.

"You dey tell us na. We wey no get doctor make we die. We wey dey use chamist cure our infection and malaria."

I didn't say a word.

One of them approached me and showed me some images on his phone.

Dead bodies.

Fresh corpses of youth, both male and female.

Lying by the bush.

Blood gushing from bullet wounds.

I looked at him, in fear.

He said.

"Shey dem dey shout end SARS we no dey catch anybody again o. But na make we see pictures of end SARS for person phone the person is gone. Dis ones wey you dey see so na some of the protesters o. Shey dey don die like dis? Dey will keep dying."

One shouted at him.

"Why you dey tell am this thing? Why you dey leak our secret? Do you know who he is?"

"Shey he talk say na filmmaker? He won't do anything."

Goosebumps rushed over me.

In actuality of how these guys are killing in reckless abandon.

The one with my phone said.

"I no see anything for him phone. He is free to go."

He handed my phone back to me.

Then said.

I took my phone and said.

"Thank you."

As I headed back to the Taxify, a Lexus Jeep was approaching behind us.

They rushed immediately and flew it to stop.

The Taxify driver got in and we started to drive off.

While I looked behind, watching as they dragged five guys out of the car.

About three wore t-shirts.

Boldly written 'EndSARS'.

The Taxify turned right at the intersection and I couldn't see anymore.

He shouted.

"Ah. These people are in trouble."

But I heard it barely ten seconds later.

It was loud from a distance.

Pooo!

Pooo!!

Pooo!!!

Three gunshots.

Whistle~Blowers in Police Force Speak Out on #EndSars 

Kayode Ogundamisi:
So a Compatriot who is serving in the Nigerian Police got in touch with me. The officer requested that the publication of the following, this was after a 30 minutes plus conversation. 👇🏿🇳🇬

For safety I will keep the name of the Police Officer out. Hoping Nigerian President and the Police can take note and verify independently.

The extortion of members of the public including #SARS is not with the Police personnel on the road, it is institutional. He claims Police Commissioner's embezzles security vote meant for the upkeep of operational officers. 

Police divisions are meant to get welfare funds but it never trickles down to low ranking officers who now buy their own uniform, fuel car from funds extorted from public.

Every Police operational team on checkpoints, raids makes a targeted KPI weekly monetary return to their commanders, DPO's and HOD's who in turn makes return to the CP of the State or the CP in-charge of the unit. These CP's makes return to IGP. The PMF is not exempted.

The posting of Squadron Commanders is not by merit. They all make returns monthly by deducting money meant for their boys on special duties (Security covers for Celebrities, rich individuals, escorting night bus for transport companies, securing social party, banks and others).

He Advised the Nigerian government to immediately ban Police officers from operational "stop any arrest" based on expiration of driving or vehicle license as it is a money making scheme. The VIO or FRSC should focus on this and transfer cases to Police if need be.

Police is highly commercialised from top to bottom, funds budgeted do not go to the rank and file, police equipment are meant to be repaired but long abandoned and they get votes every year, officers simply look for funds outside of the force to survive and live.

"I have a Phd and head a Police Tactical unit, myself and my unit work with pains and bitterness because they work under pressure to give returns to those above and nothing for them. I can not stop the boys so I lecture part time to make up for my upkeep. The rot is huge"

"They should probe training funds, they should ask why Police officers have to bribe to go on study leave. If you do not have a godfather you can not go on essential trainings, when you go, you pay back part of your allowance to the admin team in the office"

Nigerian Police get international supports for training officers, when the slot comes, you never hear anything, all international courses are shielded in secrecy and you only see privileged people go, office based staff are sent for tactical command weapons training abroad.

The problem of Nigerian Police is not just about fund, it is about accountability, a wholistic probe into the existing funds and then reform.

An average constable drives an expensive car when a DSP who chose to be honest walks on foot, the moral is low within the service.

High Returning Divisions: 

There is a division in Abia State called Ndiegoro Divisional Police Station and Eziama Divisional Police Station. Personnel of these stations just like SARS situated at Aba North LGA goes around on mini buses (Suzuki Every) with POS machines.
Every young guy on dread or rugged Jeans is a fraudster or suspected kidnapper. A certain 'Bishop' and a Police man called 'Malaysia' in Eziama division takes people at gunpoint to ATM and push them out of vehicles late at night. These bad officers can be located by Nigerian Police Force.

Anyone entering Aba late night is at risk. These men have been reported on many occasions but only asked to refund the money and nothing happens. The reason they are invincible is because senior Police officers get returns. To stop the rot, start from the head.

Ohuru-Isimiri Division in OBINGWA LGA is a nightmare to tricycle and motorcycles riders. You can visit to ask members of the public about all these stations in Aba. What happens in Aba is replicated across the other Police divisions across the country.

The public are also part of the problem of Police officers when officers do gallant jobs, we are seen as just doing our job, even when we lose officers. Nigerians have made up their mind that we are all corrupt so even those who want to be honest ask why should they bother.

The public must fight for Police officers, do you know we ration ammunitions and guns, the weapons we use against robbers with automatic weapons are outdates, when did anyone offer to visit a Police Station or barrackz to see how we live.

If #EndsSARS or #EndPoliceBrutality is to be successful, the reform must include speaking with officers who do the dirty work, right now everyone is having a conversation about us but no one is talking to us. Police are Nigerians too, we have to build trust with ourselves.

Those talking about Police officers on the streets should check how much a sergeant is paid, not to talk of a constable, you can not pay an officer 59 Thousand Naira a month, he buys uniform from it, transport and feed family and you expect the best from him.

The number of Police officers is very small, even if you reform, the number we have can not deliver the kind of magic Nigerians want the police to give. The people should not be anti police but separate the bad from the good.

I am telling you that the Police officers adopted by some States who pay them extra are doing very well, crime is low and they are dedicated. 
Nigeria should withdraw Police on 'special duties' with VIP and those with money and influence.

The Abayi Divisional Police officer recently assaulted a lady sexually and detained her for stealing his money. Let the CP investigate him. Let all SARS personnel be sent back to Police Colleges and Training Schools.

PART 2 of Thread!🇳🇬👮🏿

As Young Nigerians continue to lead #EndSars #EndPoliceBrutalityinNigeria yesterday, a Police Officer opened up about his experience. I have since had conversations with 3 other officers.*Statements not independently verified.
Key points here:👇🏿

I will call this particular Police Whistle-blower Officer A. He's based in one of the South West State, ranked as a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP).
"This ( #EndSARS ) protest is the best thing that has happened to the force, tell them to take inventory of custody files"
"We write the name of suspect on ledger, if your DPO is corrupt, you will have 2 custody ledger, one is for official, the other one is for suspect that will roga (bribe) and then they will be released, so it is like they never came to station" 

"Tell them to Probe STS and IRT under Police Force Headquarters, if they are serious, let EFCC check bank accounts of officers from IG, AIG, CP, DIG to even Sergeant, any Policeman with balance of N5Million is a thief, they can start now." 

"People should visit Police College Ikeja, or go to any training school in Nigeria, no way you can produce good officers from those places. I hear the IG praising the Tactical College Ila~Orogun on the way to Oke ile, is he joking? The place is a disgrace" 

"You put Police with their family in poultry and call it barracks, even to get 1 room in Police barracks you have to bribe, if you rent in town, you will hide yourself from criminals and your neighbours see you as one of the bad Police, the problem is big" 

"Let me tell you, when I joined Police, we had fuel dumps, where Police operational vehicles will collect fuel daily and it is full up tank, when you come back from patrol, you record mileage and refill, now no fuel dump, you have to look for money yourself" 

"When I joined Police, we had tailoring department, we had mechanics, they sow the uniform, they repair Police vehicles, now everything is to contractors, they should probe why Police can not keep subsidiary services, is it not civilians that take Police contract?" 

"I have Safer highway personnel attached to me they need over 80K periodically, service tyre themselves, change engine oil, service van, where do you think they will get the money from when the official money is not coming in?

"Regular Police officer, your course mate posted to EFCC or as ADC or orderly to Politician or to Celebrity will buy land and build house in front of you, so everybody is lobbying to leave fighting crime, if they are serious, send everybody back to beat" 

"Armed robbers and criminals are afraid of #SARS, wait till November and December if we don't have something to replace them, criminals will strike, Police cannot do without a strong tactical team but SARS has turned on innocent people, that is the problem" 

Even in Police, other officers fear #SARS. They have become a cult within Police, a lot of officers are celebrating but we know we need a tactical team. Government can probe the officers, sack the bad one, create a new discipline outfit" 
"If they round up all the SARS officers, look at their bank account, interrogate them on what they have done, what they know about killings, separate them from the command, some will confess." 
"Do you know civilians with money approach Police to exchange family members who have committed a crime with innocent people? The person making the proposal and the Police are all guilty, that is why I am now happy the young people are fighting for us"

We weren't calculating enough. We forgot we were dealing with _election manipulators_.

The protest was more of emotions and little strategic.

You don't fight a battle with emotions.

21/10/2020, 12:10 - Toyosi Ayomide Mcb: This is clearly the work of soldiers that were sent on command... How would you explain the army tanks? the army helicopters about three of them sited yesterday, that flew to places of attack? Were they also rented by hoodlums? How would you even explain the dead bodies not found? Loaded in trucks? How would you even explain the ambulances that were sent back? And Sanwo-Olu's confession that truly the army was sent, even though he's trying to deny deaths?

22/10/2020, 19:39 - Florence MCB: ADDRESS TO THE NATION BY HIS EXCELLENCY MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE ENDSARS PROTESTS

22ND OCTOBER, 2020

      Fellow Nigerians,

It has become necessary for me to address you having heard from many concerned Nigerians and having concluded a meeting with all the Security Chiefs.

 

2. I must warn those who have hijacked and misdirected the initial, genuine and well - intended protest of some of our youths in parts of the country, against the excesses of some members of the now disbanded Special Anti-Robery Squad (SARS).

 

3. On Monday 12th October, I acknowledged the genuine concerns and agitations of members of the public regarding the excessive use of force by some members of SARS.

 

4. The choice to demonstrate peacefully is a fundamental right of citizens as enshrined in Section 40 of our Constitution and other enactments; but this right to protest also imposes on the demonstrators the responsibility to respect the rights of other citizens, and the necessity to operate within the law.

 

 

 

 

5. As a democratic government, we listened to, and carefully evaluated the five-point demands of the protesters. And, having accepted them, we immediately scrapped SARS, and put measures in place to address the other demands of our youth.

 

6. On approving the termination of SARS I already made it clear that it was in line with our commitment to the implementation of extensive Police reforms.

 

7. Sadly, the promptness with which we have acted seemed to have been misconstrued as a sign of weakness and twisted by some for their selfish unpatriotic interests.

 

8. The result of this is clear to all observers: human lives have been lost; acts of sexual  violence have been reported; two major correctional facilities were attacked and convicts freed; public and private properties completely destroyed or vandalised; the sanctity of the Palace of a Peace Maker, the Oba of Lagos has been violated. So-called protesters have invaded an International Airport and in the process disrupted the travel plans of fellow Nigerians and our visitors.

 

 

9. All these executed in the name of the ENDSARS protests. I am indeed deeply pained that innocent lives have been lost. These tragedies are uncalled for and unnecessary. Certainly, there is no way whatsoever to connect these bad acts to legitimate expression of grievance of the youth of our country.

 

10. The spreading of deliberate falsehood and misinformation through the social media in particular, that this government is oblivious to the pains and plight of its citizens is a ploy to mislead the unwary within and outside Nigeria into unfair judgement and disruptive behaviour.

 

11. On the contrary, both our deeds and words have shown how committed this administration has been to the well being and welfare of citizens, even with the steadily dwindling revenues, and the added responsibilities and restrictions due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

 

12. Government has put in place measures and initiatives principally targeted at youths, women and the most vulnerable groups in our society.  These included our broad plan to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years; the creation of N75 billion National Youth Investment Fund to provide opportunities for the youths and the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Survival Fund, through which government is:

 

a. paying three months salaries of the staff of 100,000 micro, small - and medium - enterprises,

b. paying for the registration of 250,000 businesses at the Corporate Affairs Commission,

c. giving a grant of N30,000 to 100,000 artisans; and

d. guaranteeing market for the products of traders.

 

13. These are in addition to many other initiatives such as;

a. Farmermoni,

b. Tradermoni,

c. Marketmoni,

d. N-Power,

e. N-Tech and

f. N-Agro.

 

14. No Nigerian Government in the past has methodically and seriously approached poverty-alleviation like we have done.

 

15. With regard to the welfare of police personnel, the National Salaries, Income and Wages Commission has been directed to expedite action on the finalization of the new salary structure of members of the Nigeria Police Force. The emoluments of other paramilitary services are also being reviewed upwards.

 

16. In order to underscore the importance of education in preparing youths for the future, this administration has come up with a new salary structure and other incentives for our teachers.

 

17. Let me at this point reaffirm the Federal Government’s commitment to preserving the unity of this country.

 

18. We will continue to improve good governance and our democratic  process, including through sustained engagement.

 

19. We shall continue to ensure that liberty and freedom, as well as the fundamental rights of all citizens are protected.

 

20. But remember that government also has the obligation to protect lives and properties, as well as the right of citizens to go about their daily businesses freely and protected from acts of violence.

 

21. To our neighbours in particular, and members of the international community, many of whom have expressed concern about the ongoing development in Nigeria, we thank you and urge you all to seek to know all the facts available before taking a position or rushing to judgement and making hasty pronouncements.

 

22. In the circumstances, I would like to appeal to protesters to note and take advantage of the various well-thought-out initiatives of this administration designed to make their lives better and more meaningful, and resist the temptation of being used by some subversive elements to cause chaos with the aim of truncating our nascent democracy.

 

23. For you to do otherwise will amount to undermining national security and the law and order situation. Under no circumstances will this be tolerated.

 

24. I therefore call on our youths to discontinue the street protests and constructively engage government in finding solutions. Your voice has been heard loud and clear and we are responding.

 

25. And I call on all Nigerians to go about their normal businesses, and enjoin security agencies to protect lives and properties of all law abiding citizens without doing harm to those they are meant to protect. Let me pay tribute to officers of the Nigeria Police Force who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty.

 

26. I would like to thank those state Governors, traditional and religious leaders who have appealed for calm and restraint. I also thank youth leaders who have restrained their followers from taking the law into their hands.

 

27. This government respects and will continue to respect all the democratic rights and civil liberties of the people, but it will not allow anybody or groups to disrupt the peace of our nation.

 

Thank you all. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Dear Brothers and Sisters in Nigeria
On my very first visit to Nigeria in the late 1980’s, the country was under military control. As I processed through customs and immigration, each rifle carrying officer in charge would detain me and ask, “What do you have for me?” I had been through very many acts of discrimination as a Black man in America, but I had never been bribed. Evangelist Patricia Bailey, who was on the same flight with me, had pre-warned me to have some loose one dollar bills with me in case soldiers asked me for money. As I processed through the long lines at Murtala Muhammed Airport I was pulled aside 3 times and asked by the soldiers (with guns) , “What do you have for me”.

I share this story to let you know that I personally understand and identify with the frustrations that the people of Nigeria are going through at this present time. As the youth of Nigeria are rising up to say “enough is enough” to the National Government and the law enforcement organizations, my hope, my faith and my prayers are aligned with yours.

Nigerians, I believe you are a set apart nation with a Divine assignment. You have the natural resources, human resources, and the spiritual authority to make Nigeria the most desired destination on the planet for people of color. What London and Rome are to Caucasins; what Jerusalem is to Jews; and what Mecca is to Muslims, that is what you will be to black people around the world. Melinin people from all over the earth will make it their lifetime dream to come and witness the manifest accomplishments and greatness that you will display for our race.

Nigeria, you will soon be the modern day trophy of every Black man, woman boy and girl on this planet. You are the heart and soul of our Motherland. As you lead, all of Black Africa will follow you. Young people of Nigeria, the nations and multi-national corporations of the world have exploited you; the present generation of leaders have not maximized the potential of your hidden wealth and resources. Your children cry in discouragement and your elders hang their heads down with fatigue and brokenheartedness.

Young people of Nigeria, the future is in you hands. Bring Nigeria to its fullest potential! Turn the children’s tears to joy. Cause the elders to stand up straight and proud again. Remove the fear of mothers raising their children in poverty and chaos. Your obvious manifest destiny is before you, and the fruit of your labor will be waiting to be consumed.

Arise to brilliance and glory Nigeria, and let your light shine! I am praying for you!

25/10/2020, 07:33 - Babav MCB: WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT SHOULD MAKE US WISER! 

The President threat or speech yesterday broke us but thought us many hard lessons.

Myself and so many others couldn't sleep last night... We were broken!!!!!!

We protested for 12 days without vandalisation
12 days of rejecting bribe,
12 days of transport buses not giving bride to police officers,      12 days of caring and looking out for each other.
12 days of giving free medical care and legal services,

Brands, both national and international Celebrities, Churches all protested... influencial people were lobbied to add their voice...

At the protest grounds, the Christians gave room for the Muslims to have their Jumat prayers

The Christians had their service on Sunday...

There was a candlelight service held all over the nation for fallen heroes,
Youths despite the hard economy spent their personal money cooking for each other.

No one knew who was a Yoruba, Igbo or Hausa, or  Edo... We ate together and danced together.

For 12 days, These were organised without a formal leader with just social media tweets, retweets, post, shares with a harshtag. 

For 12 days we built the Nigeria of our dreams... 

And built their nightmare... And they got scared.

They know if we're united we would have one voice, 
If we have one voice, we have power.
And if we have that power... WE WOULD DEMAND A BETTER NIGERIA.

If we're united and not fighting how would they budget money for security to calm insurgency?
How will they create religious fights and make money?

So they sponsored hoodlums to disrupt the protest... But we overpowered these hoodlums by getting our own private securities and security dogs to protest grounds.

When the military who were ordered by "Powers beyond their control" to shoot,

When the guns were fired,

They didn't care who was a Muslim or Christian,
They didn't care who was Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa,  Calabar or Urhobo.

They killed unarmed people sitting down and singing the anthem.

But when they want to instigate tribal wars and religious unrest, they remind you of your tribe and religion,

When they want to make use of you for their selfish gain, they tell you to unite and take side with "your people" they remind you that you should be one.

Do you all remembered how President Buhari contested for presidency up to 5 times?

He cried on National TV when the chibok girls were kidnapped,

He promised us heaven and earth.

He campaigned rigorously,

He protested against the then government. 

He was voted in thinking he would bring change he promised... What did we get in return? 

We were handled with "iron fist"

THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE STATE OF THIS NATION!

THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF THE CITIZENS!

They do not care about the state of our hospitals because they get medical attention abroad,
They do not care about our educational system because their kids schools abroad,
They do not care about electricity because they live in choices area with constant electricity,
They travel with securities so have no idea how our roads are.

They only need us to win elections... And after then they can send the military to silent us if we remind them of their promises or demand for our rights.

We didn't loose this fight. That speech yesterday was a speech of threat and you only threaten those you are scared of to keep them in line! 😂

They are scared of us
They saw how we mobilised ourselves without a leader,
They saw how we over powered thugs with our numbers,
They saw how organised and cooperated we were.... It gave then the chills mehn 😂😂😂

WE DIDN'T LOOSE THIS FIGHT

Our parents failed because they do not have enough evidence against the leaders, but we the pressing phone generation have enough evidence to remind them of how evil, wicked and clueless they are.

Our parents failed because they had less information.

But we have a lot of information at our finger tips.

We didn't loose this fight... 

We're now Aware,
Awake,
and Alert.

We know what we're up against and we're ready. 

I am ready!

1. Get devices that can record conversation and take photos. Imagine if DJ Switch didn't go live on instagram...

2. Any friend you meet add them to your social media handle, when you're in the midst of people mostly youths, engage them in meaningful conversation... Do not engage in tribal sentiments... Most youths are not informed... If they have the information some of us have they would not have hijacked the protest, they would not be used as thugs.

3. Get your Voters card... Get your PVC If you have any political ambition start grooming yourself, we do not want to elect those with the mindset of the present leaders we have.

4. Do not give up. DO. NOT. GIVE. UP

5. Please I beg you in the name of Jesus, Allah, Sango, Orisala, Amadioha and everything worshipable under the sun... Do not let them sell tribal or religious sentiments to you.

A Yoruba man, Igbo man and Hausa man is your brother,

An Igbo woman, Hausa woman and Yoruba woman is your sister.

Remember the good times we shared at various protest grounds irrespective of tribes and religion and let Nigeria come first in your heart! 

We're young,
We are strong,
We are smart,
We are 20 steps ahead of them.

We're their nemesis
The wrong generation to mess with.

We just need to re-strategize.

Come 2023
No PDP
No APC
No recycling of Past or Present leaders.

Together shall save Nigeria and make it great again.

The officail transcript is not meant to be gotten by the individual student but receiving institution/organization (there's a way around it though)


Official copy is used for admission verification in institutions and it's the school that normally send it not the student. 


The student copy can be uploaded online to process admission while the official copy Will be required for final verification after gotten the admission.
04/11/2020, 23:55 - Ola Ke: Then how do we get the student copy? Is it the way Ife got is own or you have another way that's fast

07/11/2020, 09:24 - Haniel: Lol.... It's not our fault that you still remained an unbeliever after school. We have told you what happened, still you chose not to believe...

I'll leave you to your unbelief then👨🏽‍🦽
07/11/2020, 09:34 - Victorious: Let me wallow in my unbelief.

Nevertheless, I am very sure many are just being deceptive saying they can't remember some of those things taught in school. Like isobologram? WTF?
07/11/2020, 09:36 - TIMI Mcb: They thought us isobologram??
07/11/2020, 09:36 - TIMI Mcb: Me I just assumed it was from all the extra reading you people do...

07/11/2020, 09:37 - Haniel: Of course. But, many are only saying the truth. Isobologram was only a part of the whole thing. I could remember it because it was hard for me. 

You might not have even remembered it if I didn't mention it. ...

Many are being sincere.

There are many things someone like Florence will remember in mcb407 or mcb309 cos she likes food and business... I may not remember..

It's just individual differences... No need to make a mountain out of a molehill.
07/11/2020, 09:38 - TIMI Mcb: Isobologram!!!!!???

12/12/2020, 21:47 - Fagba: Notice of Attempt to Slander Me

Please be informed that somebody is trying to cause a false alarm by spreading a dangerous rumor that I have stopped eating chicken, turkey and goat meat.

I therefore wish to state categorically that at no time did I ever attempt to stop eating chicken, turkey and goat meat. Nor did I ever contemplate such a dangerous idea - let alone dream about it.

These are lies fabricated by my enemies who want to tarnish my hard-earned “protein-friendly” reputation by preventing my family and friends like you from offering me chicken, turkey and goat during this festive period.

I beg you all to stay calm and vigilant and ignore the rumour. Shame these miscreants by sending me the chicken, turkey and goat you intended to send. 
Please don't forget to add bag of rice and soup ingredients.
I am investigating the source of  this BlACKMAIL. I will keep you all updated on my investigation as we approach Dec 25👌​​​

12/01/2021, 12:41 - Akinkunmi Micro: I'm not sure. Seems like Nasu. The dept is locked too.
12/01/2021, 12:53 - Fagba: Hello, Good morning, Sequel to the various messages I have been getting in my DM concerning transcript application process, I want to just say a few things and hopefully it helps one or two people make the right decisions : 
 Please spare some few minutes to read through so you can be well informed 

Transcript application process should be a stress free, easy and quite straight forward thing to do in saner climes but it's not the case with oau, we all know the type of school we graduated from so it's quite expected, well that said and done, For those who wishing to go about transcript application and you're probably wondering what's happening or what are these people saying, these are the few things/ advice  you should know : 

1 If you're intending to use your transcripts anytime soon, I would suggest that you make the application now and avoid stress of having to worry about how soon it's going to reach your desired destination cos with the way things are right now , I can guarantee you that one month is the least time it could take you to get the transcript .And for information purpose : There are 2types of transcript : OFFICIAL AND UNOFFICIAL , the 
(A)official transcript is the one that is directly sent to your institution /organisation you desire, it can never be sent to you!
(B) Unofficial transcript (student copy) is the personal copy of your transcript that can be directly sent to you through your mail or a desired address..This is what most people use when applying to institutions and upon confirmation of admission, you would be required to send the official transcript which is processed directly by your institution and sent to the receiving institution/ organisation as the case may be..

For OAU, transcript application process is done online through the platform Exchange.etx.ng and you would be required to create an account and do other necessary things..Quite Straightforward actually. 

So what's the advice I have for us : It's to make sure you apply for your transcript and keep it just in case you need it so you won't have to be rushing..From experience and from otherr classmates who have tried.It takes averagely about 4-6months to get your transcript .So you don't want to lose an opportunity/ be caught unaware because you don't have transcript🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️..At least if you submit an unofficial copy you cann be granted whatever you want pending the time you send the official copy.

This is my 2cent to everyone..Thanks and Have a blessed day!
12/01/2021, 12:55 - Haniel: Exactly. 6 months minumum😅
12/01/2021, 12:55 - Haniel: Except you scale fence...
12/01/2021, 12:56 - Fagba: <Media omitted>
12/01/2021, 13:00 - Adejoke MCB: Thanks Fagba
12/01/2021, 13:03 - Fagba: For the price range, Unofficial is around 10k or so, Then the official most times depends on where you are sending it to..But once it's going out of the country, 18k and above .
12/01/2021, 13:03 - Fagba: <Media omitted>
12/01/2021, 13:03 - PASTOR Olamide MCB: Thanks for the info
12/01/2021, 13:03 - Rep mcb: Thanks bro❤️
12/01/2021, 13:36 - Jumoke Adeyemi Olatun MCB: So, we will pass for unofficial and still pay for official....wow
12/01/2021, 13:36 - Jumoke Adeyemi Olatun MCB: So, we will pay for unofficial and still pay for official?
12/01/2021, 13:48 - Fagba: Lol...yes now..although you can decide not to get the unofficial
12/01/2021, 13:49 - ~Aboo Ja'far~ SMARTLINK: 👍
12/01/2021, 13:49 - Fagba: But once you begin to do some stuff you would see the need for the unofficial

12/01/2021, 14:28 - +1 (869) 665-7631: When you apply for an official transcript, you will be given a student copy also.

12/01/2021, 14:30 - +1 (869) 665-7631: Yes, I was given
12/01/2021, 14:30 - Fagba: But I think there's a difference between the student copy and the official being sent out
12/01/2021, 14:31 - +1 (869) 665-7631: Yes there is
12/01/2021, 14:31 - Fagba: And besides if you don't have an official place like an institution/organisation  you're sending to..you won't get the student copy attached if am correct?
12/01/2021, 14:39 - +1 (869) 665-7631: Yes

15/01/2021, 06:54 - Victorious: Omo, dem still choose HND over BSc even for Microbiology related vacancies.


Una don suffer o 😂
15/01/2021, 06:56 - Webwiz: 😄
15/01/2021, 07:01 - Victorious: Make we no lie, if you have any plans, any at all, to use your Microbiology certificate in this country, simply go and get your transcript and apply for Masters.
And forget about all those "I want to do Masters in recognized schools". It's bullshit. 
Even if it's Bayero University. Make life easy for yourself. Na experience dem they count.
If you do your Masters in all those new Federal schools, you have a higher chance of being employed than in UI or OAU. 
Study in FUBK, get employed work for at least 5 years (you should have got your PhD in between) and then come back to all these big schools to come and continue your career.
15/01/2021, 07:08 - Victorious: See, "I'm a graduate of OAU" doesn't bring money to anybody's account.

And very soon, nobody will care.

It may still be fresh and sounding cool now. In 5 years, nobody will care where you graduated from.

It's what you have to show that will matter.
15/01/2021, 07:19 - Victorious: And if you're the rebellious types that have forsaken Microbiology for a new career, bros, whatever you do, get a professional certificate.
And I'm not saying all these abe igi omo certifications o. Like those ones you pay 10k for and they teach you for 2 weeks. No o.
I'm talking about something like CIPM, NIM, PMI, CFI, Azure, and Google certifications.
Spend real money to get real certifications.
I know it's not easy, but so it's getting a 2-year Masters that will still require you to have 6 years experience before you can have a good paying job.

Las Estrellas, let's be honest with ourselves. If you don't have money for certifications, and Masters, go into tech.
With Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, FutureLearn, Alison, Coursera, and the rest, you can become a badass within one year in any tech field you choose.
Then work on projects, a lot of them.
In a few years, you may not even remember the school you graduated from, except when you're reminiscing about Bablo's wickedness or singing Great Ife anthem at your wedding.

Companies are renewing their staff strengths and it will be stupid to miss out just because you don't have a well-optimized, ATS-compliant CV.
Therefore, I want to help just 5 people on my list today.
5 people only.
Get your CV reviewed for just 1500.

Festus Adedayo

Two of Yorubaland’s most prized states’ helmsmen – Governors Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and Seyi Makinde – have made very strong but seemingly diametrically opposed positions on the security of their people, making it the most talked about issue in the nation today. In recent time, their Ondo and Oyo States have become hotbeds of the scalding hot security crises in Northeastern and Northwestern Nigeria. Flakes of the unending years of savage Boko Haram war in the Northeast are whooshing gently but destructively and settling on Western Nigeria. Fleeing displaced Northerners who escape to the bosom of Oduduwa are stretching Southwest space beyond tolerable level. Infrastructure is becoming unbearably elasticized. Firepower of artilleries is stampeding insurgents from the theater of war and with mounting fire of Northwest banditry, forests of Yorubaland are now comparatively safe havens for fleeing warlords. At the same time, proceeds of kidnapping in Yorubaland are said to be surviving funds renegades of Northeast insurgents and ragtag armies of the bandits of Northwest remit home for the sustenance of their evil war. Unable to withstand the economic weather at home, their neglect by government and the Islamic tzedakah system that constituted their survival for centuries, northern beggars and vagrants are also migrating westwards in thousands.

The above alien challenges have successfully defaced the aesthetics and perforated the peace of Yorubaland. The army of beggars in Southwest today will sober even Senegalese-born author and first published Black African Francophone novelist, Aminata Sow Fall of the Beggars’ Strike fame. In Ibadan, for instance, beggars paste themselves like foamy lather round the Mokola overhead bridge, in almost a hundred, while their kindred are scattered round the city in embarrassing proportions. They even have the temerity to sun-dry their tattered clothes on the Ibadan bridge’s metal railings which they have converted into their balustrade. The second evil is the small weevils in the form of ubiquitous young northern bicycle riders, known as Okada, which infest the land like irritant locusts. They are deadly riders who have no respect for traffic rules or law and order. They are responsible for a horde of fatalities on the highway.

One man who should know, Chairman of the Oyo State Security Network Agency, codenamed Amotekun, Col Kunle Togun, (rtd) last week introduced a new dimension to the infestation. Many of the Okada riders, he said, are foreigners and spies for kidnappers and bandits who enter Yorubaland through Nigeria’s porous borders. According to him, ferried into Oyo and other Yoruba States during the COVID-19 lockdown via articulated lorries, most of these Okada riders cannot speak any of the Nigerian languages or English but French and have no known residency permit. Coming on the heels of this invasion is another internal invasion, said Togun. It comes in the form of Yoruba traditional rulers allocating lands to Fulani herdsmen and who, “take money, cows and cars from these people and allow them to settle and wreak havoc in their domains.
In January, 2018, I had written about the deadliness of Fulani herders. Fulani herdsmen have been declared one of the deadliest terrorist groups in the world by the Global Terrorism Index (GTI). In a survey, GTI said the herdsmen, mainly of the Fula ethnic group, killed 80 people in total in 2013 but by 2014, had murdered at least 1,229 people. The group, according to the report, operates between Nigeria and parts of the Central African Republic (CAR) and had killed 847 people in 2015 across five states in Nigeria through several coordinated attacks during which they inflict varying degrees of attacks on local civilian populations. According to GTI, the attacks were unleashed on private citizens and the Fulani terrorists’ primary and audacious contest is for the farmlands of their victims. These are the people the Nigerian government covers in baby shawl.
President Muhammadu Buhari and a few of his uncritical minded aides have annoyingly sought to legitimize Fulani invasion of Yorubaland and their audacious evils. In September 2018, on the sidelines of the China-Africa Cooperation Summit in Beijing, while addressing Nigerians, Buhari personally lapsed into a variant of his usual incoherent epistle, this time adumbrating why herdsmen terrorism persists in Nigeria. “To my disappointment…the press in Nigeria do not make enough efforts to study the historical antecedents of issues that are creating national problems for us,” the president had waffled, citing what he called “cultural and historical implications” as responsible for the mindless murders and impunity of his brother-Fulani herdsmen.
The last straw that broke the camel’s back was the president’s deployment of callous euphemisms in the service of his waffle. He labeled the Fulani carnage “misunderstanding, especially between herders and farmers” finally heaping the blame of the persistent murders on climate change and the drying up of Lake Chad. This, he claimed, necessitated the frenetic search for pastures by displaced cattle nomads. About the same time, his Minister of Defence, Mansur Dan Ali, another Fulani descent, toed same vacuous route of the drying-up of Lake Chad, as well as scarcity of pasture as cause of the Fulani mayhem. At another forum, we were told that renegades of Muammar Gaddafi’s armed men found their ways out of Tripoli to Nigeria with weapons and mutated into the killer herdsmen. At yet another forum, Buhari laid the blame squarely on the doorsteps of ISIS and later, on spiritic opposition members who, in the quest to tar-brush his government, have been funding the mayhem. Buhari’s incoherence has ceased to baffle intelligent listeners.
When it was reported that this self-same Fulani herdsmen had killed Mrs. Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Afenifere leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti, along the Ondo-Ore road bordered by thick forests, Buhari again deployed his legendary incoherence. Fulani herdsmen were not responsible for her murder. Armed robbers, he said, killed her.
Unarguably, no one in the Buhari government has been as recklessly audacious in hurting victims of herdsmen’s terrorism as Garba Shehu, the President’s media aide. Shehu has constituted himself into the most notorious presidential megaphone renowned for his divisive comments on Nigeria’s interminable insecurity issue. A few hours after Governor Akeredolu articulated the views of the people he governs, announcing that the Ondo forest, which Fulani herders use as umbrella to commit heinous acts of murder and mindless terrorism, would no longer be accessible for their impunity, Garba shot a verbal poisonous arrow at the people of Ondo State, nay Yorubaland.
Clothing his garrulousness in the cloak of law, his statement also rankled with an argumentative pitfall called appeal to the person. Shehu began his fallacy with Akeredolu being “a seasoned lawyer, Senior Advocate of Nigeria and indeed, a former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA)” and that he had “fought crime in his state with passion and commitment,” but, “in our view,” he said, “would be the least expected to unilaterally oust thousands of herders who have lived all their lives in the state on account of the infiltration of the forests by criminals.” Garba’s doggerel also appealed to “rights groups” and “makers of our constitution” who he said would be worried by Akeredolu’s action which he claimed “could set off a chain of events which he foresaw and tried to guard against.” He was apparently borrowing a leaf from his master’s incoherence.
To begin with, that statement was one of the swiftest to come from a presidency that seems in perpetual somnolence. It underscores Fulani issue being at the core of Buhari’s emotions. It came less than 24 hours after Akeredolu’s. As usual, it was a bid to again beatify Fulani herders who are known to be responsible for the spate of kidnappings and murders in the Southwest. But Akeredolu would not allow such hogwash dressed in a presidential bandana. “Shehu’s statement is a brazen display of emotional attachments and it’s very inimical to the corporate existence of Nigeria. We need clearly defined actions on the part of the federal government to decimate the erroneous impression that the inspiration of these criminal elements masquerading as herdsmen is that of power,” he said. He successfully echoed bothers on the streets that the Buhari government provides a nestling comfort and hibernation for Fulani killers and values the lives of his fellow Fulani cows more than Nigerians’.
Compared to the unusual valour, courage and strength demonstrated by Akeredolu, on the superficial, Makinde sounded like one kowtowing before the Fulani vermin sucking the blood of Yorubaland. However, if you were abreast of some of the issues oscillating in Oyo State, you cannot but act with Makinde’s kind of caution. One is that, but for his latter-day claim to fighting for the people, the name Sunday Igboho was associated with violence, land-grabbing, tyranny and political gangsterism. Hundreds of families who have, over the years, fallen victim of Igboho’s land-related violence would be very circumspect on the real motive of his new-found activism.
I suspect that this de-javu undergirded the governor’s fear on Igboho. Should government accommodate the Igboho irritancy and promote outlaws in urgent thirst of rebranding into undeserved heroism? Which is more desirable in the bid to rout the Fulani criminal elements: embrace the crudity of rogue elements and their lawlessness, resort to their outlandish interventions and by that, justifying the pains and despair they inflicted on the people? In theory, any government which openly goes into an unholy dalliance with the lord of thugs cannot earn the respect of the people of Oyo State.
However, the above operates in the realm of theory.  No governor is Chief Security Officer of his state, except in nomenclature. Seizing on the vacuum in security over the years and the known powerlessness of governors to rescue them from their tormentors, Igboho has become a hero among the traumatized people of Oyo State and as such, response to his call to arms is awesome. His heroism seems to have obliterated the long years of his infamy from the minds of the people. Today, Igboho is the David to the rescue of the people from the Fulani Goliath, their own Ogbomoso’s Ogbori Elemoso of the 15th century, and Makinde seems inconsequential in the equation.
So, is Sunday Igboho a reincarnation of Ogunlola? The story of Elemoso cannot be divorced from the Ogbomosho history, its civilization and conquest. It is the story of Olabanjo Ogunlola Ogundiran, an Ibariba. In 1650, history reported that Ogunlola and his wife named Esuu migrated to current site of Ogbomoso in continuation of his hunting expeditions. They settled beside the Ajagbon tree. With other hunters, Aale, a Nupe descendant; Onisile and Orisatola, they formed the Alongo, a system of administration aimed at securing their settlement against wild animals and enemy invasion. Imprisoned in Oyo-Ile for his oft delve into criminal activities, Ogunlola heard of the notoriety of a wicked and deadly character called Elemoso who was terrorizing Oyo-Ile people. He was believed to be a spirit. Ogunlola then went to the Alaafin to ask for his permission to confront this terror. At the palace, as Ogunlola told the king of his quest, palace courtiers shouted, “Elemoso, eni t’a o ri! Iwo ke! – Elemoso, an invincible man! You?” Grudgingly, Alaafin gave him the go-ahead and Ogunlola stormed Elemoso’s camp and shot him with an arrow, beheaded him and proceeded to the palace with the decapitated Elemoso.
On the surface and judging by his actions since he became governor, Makinde doesn’t seem to harbor any motive to be a Fulani fawner. More than many of his ilk in the PDP, he has fought the Buhari government’s policies most vigorously and has made the federal government look very stupid thereby, subtly underscoring the tissues of issues in true practice of federalism. His stubborn defiance of federal government’s herd mentality of COVID-19 lockdown and school resumption dates are core examples.
That notwithstanding, Makinde and the rest governors of the Southwest would need to flirt after what I call the Akeredolu spirit if they are to be respected by their people. Not doing this will make them to be worthless in the people’s estimation like Muhammadu Buhari and his government. This must however be executed with strict adherence to law and superior logic that the Yoruba are known by, the type that Akeredolu is deploying on Fulanis in Ondo State.

For some weeks now, that irrepressible Ibadan-based broadcaster, Edmund Obilo, has been bringing out the lamentable plights of the people of Igangan in the hands of Fulani herders and drawing out Makinde to confront them headlong. We all know that this won’t happen. With Buhari lionizing the herders in their infamy, no policeman will follow any governor on this suicidal mission.

Yes, I believe that Igboho is very central to this war now. However, he must go through some purgatory, be cleansed of the land-grabbing blood in his hands and return to the fold as leader of the traditional military response to the Fulani menace. There must be genuine repentance and forgiveness for his horde of infractions from thousands of people he inflicted pains upon. The next step would be for Makinde to collaborate with him after his penance to jointly rout the foreign invaders. None of the duo can do it alone. The two, with the support of Amotekun and the science of African metaphysics, should militantly move into the troubled areas of the state where Fulani herdsmen’s vitriol is most burningly dominant and, like Babagana Zulum, working with natives, smoke the blood-sucking deviants back to their land of infamy.

They should both forget their individual political leanings for now, for the sake of the people. This is because, as Bob Marley sang, all the Fulani criminals and their patrons in government desire at this moment for their evil to thrive is for the governor and Igboho “to keep fussing and fighting.” If government militarily descends on Igboho now, he may sprout uncontrollably and become another Muhammed Yusuff, progenitor of Boko Haram insurgency, whose rout by ex-Gov Ali Modu Sheriff and federal government precipitated the colossal havoc today on Nigeria. Igboho will even have the sympathy of the people. I will support him.

Again and very urgently too, Makinde should stampede out those foreigners and their local Fulani accomplices on Okada terrorizing the people. He should also rid Mokola Bridge, as well as the streets of Oyo State, of the eyesore of Northern Nigerian beggars who are defacing its environmental aesthetics and highly burnished peace. If Kaduna’s Nasir el-Rufai and Kano’s Ganduje could deport the eyesore of Almajiri from their states, South West has no business cuddling the menace that the North brought upon itself.

Being firm against the impunity and terrorism of Fulani herders is where the Southwest must begin to externalize what it means by restructuring, a la security. It should then proceed to escalate it further. The ultimate should be a campaign across the region, which must begin now, that only a bastard child of Yorubaland will vote in an unrestructured Nigeria in 2023. By then, Buhari, his Fulani stock and the bastards among Yoruba children who have already begun to campaign for positions in an unrestructured 2023 Nigeria, will begin to take Yorubaland seriously. We must stop them in this act of grabbing spoons to swallow their electoral vomit.

As I was putting my submissions to bed, I learnt that the federal government had ordered Igboho’s arrest. Great. It seems thesis and antithesis are about to clash so that we can see a synthesis. Perhaps this will speed up the denouement of this Fulani grisly drama. If a Buhari who has never put any Fulani murderer on trial in his over five years reign suddenly recognizes the colour of law and order, then let’s see whether Yoruba will allow this presidential tribal impunity to stand.

29/01/2021, 23:36 - Victorious: Dear Microbiology Students, 

I am the American Society for Microbiology Young Ambassador to Nigeria and I'll like to hear from you!

My goal is to set up an online mentorship program that connects microbiology students with professionals in the field. This aim is to provide guidance to students on career prospects as well as offer advice and support towards making an impact.

But in order for me to do this, I would like to hear from you!

It would only take a few minutes of your time to answer some important questions on our survey. This survey examines your level of understanding about microbiology practice in Nigeria.

We value your opinion and we'd love to have you contribute to making this program a reality!

Do you have few minutes to take the survey? You do?
Great!

08/02/2021, 20:12 - Florence MCB: In december of 2003, Joyce Vincent died of an apparent asthma attack in her north London flat. The television was left on. The mail continued to be delivered. Her rent was set up to be automatically deducted from her bank account. The days rolled by and no one noticed she was gone.

Those days turned into weeks and the weeks into months. There were large trash dumpsters on the side of the building next to her unit, so the neighbors never thought much of the smell emanating from her flat. The floor was full of noisy kids and teenagers and no one questioned the constant thrum of television noise in the background.

Eventually, Joyce’s bank account dried up. Her landlord sent her letters of collection. These letters, like the others, simply fell into the stacks scattered about her floor. They went unanswered. Finally, with more than six months of overdue rent, the landlord got a court order to forcibly remove her from the premises. The bailiffs broke down the door, and it was only then her body was discovered. By then, it was January, 2006, more than two years after she passed away.

In that time, nobody ever came looking for Joyce Vincent. No family. No friends. No co-workers. No neighbor knocked on the door to see if things were all right. Nobody called. Nobody checked in. She was 38-years-old when she died.

This story is jaw-dropping in its social implications. It feels unfathomable that entire years could go by with no one noticing a person has died. Yet, these sorts of stories happen frequently. Chances are you’ve seen a news story similar to the one about Joyce Vincent. And they are all the same.

Person lives alone. They lose touch with family and friends. They never meet their neighbors. They stay shut in with their television or computer for years at a time. The world moves on as if they are no longer there until one day, they are no longer there. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Vincent 

Let’s do our little to keep the human touch/ connection. Let's not fall too apart. Bless 

Have a blessed week.
Peace & Love 💕

11/02/2021, 09:33 - +234 705 856 5955: *DOCTOR THIS IS MY FIFTH MISCARRIAGE IN FIVE YEARS OF MARRIAGE; WHO DID I OFFEND?: A SHOCKING REVELATION FROM INSIDE MY CONSULTING ROOM.*

I have the permission of Mrs. Funke to share her painful life journey with you so that you can learn from her bitter experience.

I was inside my consulting room on the fateful day when a young married woman, 25 years old, walked in, looking depressed. She sighed as she sat. The perplexity on her face said it all. There was a big burden being carried in her heart. I mustered the courage to ask "how may I help you madam?" then she answered in her frustration. "DOCTOR THIS IS MY FIFTH MISCARRIAGE IN FIVE YEARS OF MARRIAGE; WHO DID I OFFEND?"

Now it was like it was my turn to be frustrated because how could I know the person offended in this issue. Well I summoned courage to overcome the perplexity, I went further to be sure she actually had five miscarriages as she had said. "Madam Funke did you actually confirm these five pregnancies with pregnancy tests or scan to start with ?" She answerd yes affirmatively with tears in her eyes and her voice shaking vigorously. "Doctor I did with both pregnancy test and scan. I confirmed the pregnancy I was sure doctor." "I understand your pains madam" I responded calming her down. 

Then I asked her the next question" These five miscarriages you have had, can you tell me around what time you usually have them?" "Around 5 to 6 months doctor" she answered with tears rolling down her two cheeks. "Calm down madam I understand how you feel" I said offering her handkerchief to clean her eyes.  With the emotional atmosphere inside my consulting room I had to pause the consultation to allow her calm down and express her pains in tears. "Who would blame a woman who was lucky to get married to a supportive and loving young man at age of 20 all for her to face this kind of hurdle with five miscarriages in five years?" I said within me. The agony could only be imagined. 

After the situation had calmed down, we continued our conversation because we had to get to the root of this matter before we could provide a solution to this perennial calamity that had plagued this new, young family. From all she had said so far there was one thing that kept ringing in my mind and that was the issue of  blood group incompatibility. I went ahead to ask her "what is your blood group?" "Doctor what does my blood group have to do with this problem?" She answerd me looking surprised. I implored her to answer the question. She said O NEGATIVE. "my husband and I did it before we got married. My husband is O POSITIVE AND I am O NEGATIVE". Now the guess on my mind was becoming a reality.

"So madam have you ever done abortion before, may be before marriage?". She looked at me and was silent, put her right hand on her chin,removed it and retreated into her chair. She breathed heavily again. After a while she said "In my 200 level, I did abortion 3 times for my boyfriend on campus. I was not ready for any pregnancy then but doctor does that have something to do with the present miscarriages I am having?" "Well may be madam" I answered. "Do you know the blood group of your campus boyfriend?" I asked. She answered with mixed feelings "doctor I dont know his blood group, we just dated for like two years, she was my only boyfriend before I met my husband."

"Can you call him madam to ask?" I told her. She reacted "who? My ex? Nooo doctor we no longer talk, he was not happy I left him for my present husband". I appealed to her to at least try and make the call. She reluctantly agreed and called him. After calling 3 times he finally picked the call. "Yes madam what do we owe this call o?" The voice from the other side resonated angrily "or have you come to break our heart again?" I could hear because the phone was on loud speaker. She mustered courage and went straight to ask him about the blood group. The campus boyfriend was surprised that she didn't know his blood group in their two years together.
"So Funke you mean all the times we were together you didn't know my blood group? How would you even know when your mind was occupied with another man. Why are you asking me anyway? What has my blood group got to do with your marriage?" he asked spitefully. 

When I saw the bitterness between two of them was still fresh and this was delaying my diagnosis I signalled to her to allow me talk to him. So I collected the phone and introduced my self and appealed to him to please tell her the answer. Then he revealed he was O POSITIVE. Then I sank into my seat. My diagnosis was almost complete, the only thing left was to do a test to confirm it. I explained to her that all these revelations from both her past boyfriend and present husband blood group and her own blood group might have caused the collision in former pregnancies she aborted and could cause the present repeated miscarriages. 

She said in surprise "I was thinking only genotype couples have  problem with in marriage?" I answered her no. A couple could also have problem of miscarriages if their blood groups were not compatible. She was really shocked to know this for the first time. The next question on her mind was "does this mean I will not be able to have a child again in my life and I will continue to have miscarriages like this?" She burst into tears again. I consoled and reassured her that there was still chance of having her own baby, more efforts would just be needed but the chance of having another miscarriage was still there.

I gave her a test called INDIRECT COOMBS TEST to do to know if clash had actually occured in her blood due to past abortions done for the campus boyfriend but before she agreed she insisted I should explain how this could be. Then I took time to explain to her thus: "when a woman is O NEGATIVE and her partner is O POSITIVE, when the woman gets pregnant the baby will most likely have the blood group of the father which is O POSTIVE. When a woman with the O NEGATIVE BLOOD carries the baby with O POSITIVE BLOOD, their blood must not touch each other. If anything like abortion occurs and the O NEGATIVE BLOOD of the mother touches the O POSITIVE BLOOD of the baby, some antibody will develop inside the blood of the mother as a result of this, then next pregnancies of the woman will be attacked by the antibodies and the babies will be killed, leading to more abortions. This is what I thought has happened to you madam." 

She sank into her chair again and sighed for the third time. she was overwhelmed by all these revelations about BLOOD GROUP ISSUES IN MARRIAGE. It sounded unbelievable to her that blood group could give couples this much problem in marriage. After she had regained herself, she promised to do the test and bring the result later. Two weeks later, she brought the result, it was POSITIVE, confirming my diagnosis.

I broke the news to her, she wept again but I counselled and consoled her and promised her we would do our best in subsequent pregnancies to see she has her own child. I told her to come early when she gets pregnant again. As she was leaving my consulting room that morning, so many lessons engulfed my mind. Below are a few of them:

*Lesson number 1:*
 
I think we health care workers are not educating the public enough on the role of BLOOD GROUP IN MARRIAGE, the benefits and the risks. We only focus on genotype. More people are aware of issues of genotype more than blood group. On this i think we have to start educating the populace more.

*Lesson number 2:*

I have said this before and I will say it again. Premarital sex has consequences and complications which can affect the future seriously. Sex is only meant for married people,delay it till marriage.

*Lesson number 3:*

If eventually you get involved in premarital sex and you get pregnant, avoid doing abortion because abortion also has many consequences and complications that can lead to future infertility if you are lucky you do not die in the process of committing the abortion.
Thank you for your time for reading this article. I hope you have learnt one or two lessons from it.👇

*From the part adviser*

*Those that still can't register for less than 15 units should register their courses and make it up to 15 units with electives they've passed already then they will submit, after which they should go back to register courses and delete the electives they registered and submit again*

*For Example someone that wants to register MCB 301 And 303 only and had passed SEO 001, SEO 002, SEA 001, and SEA 002.*

*He should register for MCB 301,CB 303, SEA 001, SEA 002, SEO 001 and SEO 002. So the total units should be 16 units*

*Then he should go back to delete all the elective i.e SEA 001, SEA 002, SEO 001, SEO 002 By clicking on the delete tags*

*This is just a temporary solution as normal registration is closing today*

*Note that you must still fill the form of less than 15 units and submit to Mr. Aregbesola latest next week as you are still registering less than 15 unts*

22/02/2021, 20:26 - Rep mcb: Yes! They felt cheated!
22/02/2021, 20:26 - Rep mcb: Major challenges that foist the agitation for creation of Ekiti State in 1979 started from within the Government of the ruling Unity Party of Nigeria in old Ondo State. It was the leading political party in the South West 
Nigeria, the political base of Chief Obafemi Awolowo. The geo-political set-up of Ondo State in many respects requires good leadership that can deal with the usual jealousy or bitterness among ethnic groupings without sentiments or punitive reactions, in order to eliminate opposition. 

However, Chief Ajasin as the Governor in 
1979-83 was faced with this great challenge, but unable to master it outside securing the measure of loyalty displayed towards him and the party. This led to conspiracies which polarized the party membership, staring with Ekiti versus non–Ekiti affairs, and later changing its character to Ajasin Group versus Anti-Ajasin Group and lastly as Ajasin versus Omoboriowo Group by September 1982.

The first significant challenge leading to the agitation for state creation began with the disgruntlement that arose within the UPN party structure in January 1980 during the party’s post-election conference held at Akure. 

Several party officials of Ekiti origin came to the realization of the fact that the State Governor and UPN State Chairman - Chief Adekunle Ajasin was carrying out policies which was detrimental to the Ekiti’s interest. Their complaints were related to the ways and means of appointment of various political appointees. 

An unfortunate aspect of their complaint was the neglect of Ajasin’s co-contestants who came from Ekiti area and their 
supporters in the distribution of several political positions. These youthful elements had a pressuring demand to 
convince the main Ekiti Leader in the party - Chief Joel Ehinafe Babatola (Olora of Ado-Ekiti) to take up the matter and seek redress with the Governor.

Another major allegation which stood on its own merit was that Chief Ajasin changed the appointment of the Rector of Ondo State Polytechnic, Owo from one Prof. Adeyemi who scored 63.5% in favour one Dr. Adeyeri (from Owo) who scored 61% because the former is from Iyin Ekiti and relative of an opposition party (NPN)
chieftain at the time. These developments therefore attracted sympathy and the need to address Governor Ajasinto get a fair deal. Overtures were made to the Governor, but met stiff opposition response, being misinterpreted as a challenge on his position as the Chief Executive of the State and the political party.

Chief J.E. Babatola (1990) recounted the ill disposition to Ekiti’s interest in party caucuses and tenders’ board meetings by Governor Ajasin who was fond of making wrong allegations against Ekiti Federal and Regional Ministers of the First Republic, stating that they influenced and rigged the actual head count of 1963 census whenever his attention was called to issues of population in the distribution of amenities. This fact estranged many Ekiti political leaders from him because it was an indictment on their past good records and a political blackmail to undermine their efforts to secure a fair share of the state-cake. 

Governor Ajasin was frequently cited as making case for sitting of government projects using sub-ethnic divisions in the State which he divided into 6 regions namely: Ekiti, Akure, Ondo, Okitipupa, Owo and Akoko rather than the use of population and geographical spread. Agitators for Ekiti’s right felt that the area deserves to be divided into at least 4 major 
regions namely Ekiti Central I, Ekiti Central II, Ekiti North and Ekiti South apart from 5 created by Ajasin in other areas since Ekiti constituted the largest political division in the State. Many of the agitators were 
eventually removed from office and replaced with Ajasin’s cronies and proselytes.

The widened gulf between Ekitis and Non-Ekitis in Ajasin’s administration later took the turn of coercion and re-alignment when the Awolowo factor came into the picture. Notable political decision of Ajasin’s 
administration that fueled Ekiti versus Non-Ekiti gap and gave birth to party factions included refusal of the Governor in 1981 to hand over to his Deputy Governor (an Ekiti man) while on vacation; rumour of private 
instructions given to civil servants and political aides to disregard the 1963 population census in allocating facilities to communities as well as payments of contractors, which led to irrational distribution of benefits; 

Ajasin’s removal and displacement of his cabinet and Board members of Ekiti Origin in the likes of Chief Wumi Falodun (Ikole-Ekiti), Chief M.O Babatunde (Ado-Ekiti), Prof. C.S. Ola (Efon Alaaye), Dr. Bode Olowoporoku and Chief S. Akerele (Aiyede Ekiti). Other similar issues included the deposition of certain Chiefs at Ilawe-
Ekiti; redeployment of Ekiti Public servants; Criteria for the appointment of Board members of Corporations and appointment of Permanent Secretaries; establishment of State owned industries and companies; Creation of the State University at Ado-Ekiti with idea of multi-campuses and the State owned Bank- Owena Bank with branches across the State on geo-political basis; and proposal for the creation of 19 Local Government Councils for non-Ekiti area while 14 were proposed for Ekiti areas, which had a larger population.

Attempt to resolve the problems created the birth of two groups more distinctively from the events at the Ondo State House of Assembly Debates of Wednesday 11th November, 1981 with the Ajasin Group being led by Governor Ajasin and the Omoboriowo Group led by Chief Babatola. Although, Chief Ajasin delivered a Press 

Statement in 1981 titled ‘My Life is Devoid of Ethnic Bias’, it was however on record that he could not justify all his actions against Ekiti leaders in the party.

In the Daily Sketch Newspaper of 13th November, 1981, Governor Ajasin stated that he removed an Ekiti Leader - Dr. Bode Olowoporoku from office on allegation that he was ‘disloyal…impossible to work with all Permanent Secretaries and Senior Officers’. Ajasin’s removed another Ekiti leader - Chief S.A. Akerele on premise that he ‘prevented Radio announcement of UPN supporters who paid money to the Corporation to advertise their party’s activities’. The same pattern was noted in a report of Nigerian Tribune Newspaper of 13th

November, 1981 where Ajasin defended his summary removal of an Ekiti man – Prof. C.S. Ola (of Efon Alaaye Ekiti) as Secretary to the State Government arising from what he termed having ‘found it difficult to work with me’. 

After series of meetings of the Ekiti party members, a motion was carried for an en mass resignation of all Ekitis from the UPN to stigmatize Chief Ajasin, but Chief Babatola blocked the move because he considered it as over-reaction. The caucus was able to however commence the process for State creation while attempts were made to bring Chief Awolowo into confidence to use the party structure to whip back Chief Ajasin into line. 

Chief Obafemi Awolowo visited Ondo State to mediate in the broiling issues at Akure on 27th February, 1982and a Treaty of Peace containing 22 terms was drawn up and signed by Chief Ajasin, Chief Akin Omoboriowo and a few others, but it was all in vain. 

It became apparently clear to Ekitis in the old Ondo State that they are destined to play the role of second fiddle in a state where they toil and lead various initiatives to foster her growth and development, unless effort is made to aspire for a separate state within the comity of Nigerian Federation. As much as development seems far away from various Ekiti communities, development of infrastructures and attraction of wealth and income generating industries and opening up of the towns and villages, were issues of neglect and politics of development, apart from by-pass of potential manpower of the State in matters of leadership and government patronage.

26/02/2021, 15:23 - +234 808 030 2766: *Procedure for clearance*

1- Get the clearance form from photocopy stand

2- Start with Library as it does not require you to have done any other clearance before

3- Bring along all your library cards, If you don't have your library cards just tell them they will direct you on what to do

4- Print your clearance form from your part 4 portal (click on reports to download the clearance form)

5- Proceed to Senate and don't forget to fill your name after they've signed and you've submitted your clearance form

6- You can then go for DSA clearance

Note: You don't have to pay N500 again for DSA clearance it was later removed

But if you insist on paying they will gladly accept
26/02/2021, 15:24 - +234 808 030 2766: Departmental clearance can only be done after they've approved our results
